::: {.callout-note}
This practical session is less guided than usual in order to give you more freedom
to explore and produce a document.

## Initializing the document

::: {.callout-tip}
## Exercice 1: Creating the file

1. Click on `File > New file > Quarto document`:
    + Provide a title and an author for the report
    + Choose `HTML` as the output format
    + Uncheck the `Use visual markdown editor` option
2. Save the file under the name `report.qmd`.
3. In the file _header_,
modify the publication metadata (title, author, date, etc.)
using some of the options from [this page](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html).
5. Write a first sentence in the body of the document using
one or two elements of `Markdown` syntax for formatting.
For example, make part of the text bold. 
6. Add a level-2 heading (two `#`) to create an `About` section
and write one or two sentences in it.
6. Render the document by clicking on the `Render` button:

![Source: [Hello Quarto! by `Posit`](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html#rendering) ](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-render.png)

## Exercice 2: Inserting `R` outputs

1. Choose one of the chapters we previously worked on
for which we produced a graph or a map.
Reuse the example code from the solution (data import and visualizations)
and insert it into the document.

2. Compile the document. If there are errors, read them carefully and fix them
in order to obtain a reproducible document.

3. Use the `GT` package to create a nice table,
for example a descriptive statistics table (a mean, for instance).

## Exercice 3: Styling

Customize the output to obtain an aesthetically pleasing document.
To do so, you may use a template.

:::


::: {.callout-note}
On a `Mac` {{< fa brands apple >}}, some useful characters
are more difficult to type. For example, `|`
can be obtained using the following shortcut:
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>
