# General overview

## Data proliferation {.nonincremental}

- Digitalization and technological innovation have slashed the cost of data production.
    + Exponential growth in the volume of data generated.
- The use of statistics for governance is not new (cf. [Desrosières](https://www.cairn.info/la-politique-des-grands-nombres--9782707165046.htm) or [Ian Hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taming_of_Chance))...
- ... but numbers now hold a central place in public debate and policy-making ([Supiot](https://www.fayard.fr/sciences-humaines/la-gouvernance-par-les-nombres-9782213681092), [Davies](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/19/nervous-states-william-davies-review)).

## Data diversification (1/4)

### Classic tabular data {.nonincremental}

- **Structured** data in table format (rows and columns).
![Source: [Hadley Wickham, _R for data science_](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/images/tidy-1.png)
- {{< fa brands r-project >}} is exceptionally well-equipped for this (handled via dataframes).

## Data diversification (2/4)

### Geospatial data {.nonincremental}

- Tabular data with a spatial dimension.
    + Geography comes in multiple forms: points, lines, polygons...
- {{< fa brands r-project >}} offers powerful tools for this type of data (as long as data volume fits in memory).

## Data diversification (3/4) {.smaller}

### Textual and unstructured data {.nonincremental}

- Historical statistical roots ([Levenshtein 1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance), [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)).
- Rapid development since 2010:
    + Massive collection: social media, open-ended survey questions...
    + Lower storage costs and increased computing power.
    + New techniques: webscraping, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and LLMs.

- Heavy usage across government, research, and the private sector.

## Data diversification (4/4)

### Images, sound and video {.nonincremental}

- Computer vision and signal processing are now part of the statistical toolkit (e.g., analyzing satellite imagery for agricultural yields).


## Emergence of new players {.nonincremental.smaller}

- [**Traditional actors**]{.orange}: 
    + National Statistical Institutes (Insee, BoS Lesotho) and line ministries;
    + Central administrations (Tax authorities, Digital agencies) or mapping agencies (e.g., IGN);
    + More details to follow.
- [**Crowdsourced and collaborative projects**]{.orange}: 
    + `OpenStreetMap Lesotho` (essential for local infrastructure mapping);
    + `Wikidata`, `OpenFoodFacts`...

## Emergence of new players {.nonincremental.smaller}

- [**Private sectors**]{.orange}:
    + Vast datasets collected from users and customers (Big Data);
    + New opportunities for data-sharing partnerships (e.g., for research or public health);
    + **The challenge**: How to integrate these non-traditional sources into official statistics? (ex: [UNECE](https://unece.org/statistics/access-privately-held-data))

## The democratization of data {.nonincremental .smaller}

- **The rise of Open Data and Open Source**:
    + Global momentum for government transparency (starting in the late 2000s).
    + Rapid growth of national and international open data portals (World Bank, UN, National Platforms).
- **Technological and cultural shifts**:
    + Generalization of open and standardized formats.
    + Mass adoption of open-source programming languages (especially `Python` {{< fa brands python >}} and `R` {{< fa brands r-project >}}).
    + Increasing use of **APIs** for direct data retrieval.

## _Data is everywhere_

![](img/moredata.png)

# Data sources and ecosystems

## National Statistical Institutes (BoS & Insee) {.nonincremental .smaller}

- **Core missions**: Both the **Bureau of Statistics (Lesotho)** and **Insee (France)** share the same fundamental goals:
    - Collecting and analyzing vital data: Census, GDP, Inflation (CPI), and Labor Force Surveys.
- **Specific feature**: Insee also has a strong mandate for social and economic research to inform public debate.
- **The R Ecosystem**: 
    - Many NSI datasets are now directly accessible through **R packages**.
    - This ensures **reproducibility**: your analysis can be updated instantly when the BoS or Insee releases new data.

## National Open Data Portals {.nonincremental .smaller}

- **The Hub**: A single platform centralizing data from all public sectors (Health, Transport, Local districts).
- **Transparency**: Allows citizens and researchers to find and reuse raw data.
- **The R advantage**: Instead of manual downloads, we use R to query these portals directly, ensuring our analysis stays up-to-date.

## Why does this matter for this training ? {.nonincremental .smaller}

> In the past, we had to "ask" for data. Today, we **programmatically access** it. 
> Whether you are at BoS Lesotho, Insee, or a mapping agency, **R** is the bridge between these portals and your analysis.


## `GitHub` {{< fa brands github >}}: Where the code lives {.nonincremental .scrollable}

- **Collaborative platform**: A global hub for sharing and hosting code.
- **Much more than just code**:
    - Project documentation and tutorials;
    - Professional websites and dashboards (like the ones we can build with R).
- **The home of Open Source and Reproducible Research**:
    - Where NSIs (like Insee, Stats NZ, or UK ONS) share their methodology;
    - Allows for transparent and verifiable statistical production.

# Why use {{< fa brands r-project >}} ?

## The principle of an open source language {.nonincremental .smaller}

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![General principle](img/cartons.png)

![Illustration with `R`](img/cartons-r.png)
:::

## What is `R`? {.nonincremental}

- An **open source** statistical software:
    + Core language for base operations
    + **Packages** to extend functionalities
- Widely adopted across academia and public administrations
- Extensive online support and resources

:::{.callout-note}
- Created in the 1990s;
- Massive growth since 2010 (rising alongside `Python`).
- **RStudio**: the next-generation IDE that makes R accessible and powerful for data science.
:::

## A "swiss army knife" software {.nonincremental }

- Handling all types of data;
- Data visualization (dataviz), mapping and GIS;
- Modeling (machine learning, network analysis...)
- Writing reports, websites, and slides (like these ones 🤓)...

## A "swiss army knife" software {.nonincremental }

You can do everything in `R`:

![Excerpt from [_R for data science_ (the bible)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)](img/data-science-workflow.png)

## Transparency and reproducibility {.nonincremental .scrollable}

- Traceability of statistics and graphical outputs.
- Sharing `R` code ensures methodological transparency:
    + More and more journals now require code submissions!
    + Still some progress to be made in the field.
- Using `R Markdown` (or Quarto) increases efficiency 🐢🔜🐇:
    + Eliminates messy intermediate files (text, excel, images...).
    + Saves time on formatting (millions of hours saved, literally).

::: {.callout-note}
See the dedicated course on [best practices](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/formation-bonnes-pratiques-git-R) (Insee is highly involved in this topic).
:::

## A community of users {.nonincremental}

- An **open source** software:
    + Free and collaborative.
- Thousands of packages:
    - on `CRAN` (*The Comprehensive R Archive Network*).
    - on `GitHub`.
- A community driven by open science ideals.
- A bridge between disciplines: sociology, economics, biology, political science, etc.
- **The power of collaboration**: R thrives because users build their own tools and share them with the world.

## The `RStudio` Interface {.nonincremental }

![The four main panes of RStudio](https://bookdown.org/ageraci/STAT160Companion/images/rstudiopanes.png)

## The `RStudio` Interface {.nonincremental .smaller}

![The four main panes of RStudio](https://bookdown.org/ageraci/STAT160Companion/images/rstudiopanes.png){fig-align="left"}

- **Source** (Top Left): Your script editor. This is where you write and save your code.
- **Console** (Bottom Left): Where the code actually runs. You can type commands here for quick tests.
- **Environment** (Top Right): Shows your active data, variables, and history.
- **Output Panes** (Bottom Right): Where you see your plots, files, and help pages.

## Is RStudio really the next-generation IDE ? {.nonincremental .scrollable} 

- **[RStudio is now Posit]{.orange}**: The company changed its name to show they support more than just R (Python, Julia, etc.).
- **[The rise of VS Code]{.orange}**: Many data scientists are moving toward **VS Code**, a universal editor that is becoming the industry standard. 
- **[Why change ?]{.orange}**: VS Code is faster, supports multiple languages better, and has a massive ecosystem of extensions. 

::: {.callout-note}
### The take-away
Learn RStudio today because it's the easiest for beginners. But keep an eye on **VS Code**, it is likely where the future of professional data science is heading.
:::

## Why move from RStudio to VS Code ? {.nonincremental .scrollable}

- **Polyglot**: Work on R {{< fa brands r-project >}}, Python {{< fa brands python >}}, and SQL {{< fa database >}} in the same window.
- **Performance**: More lightweight and stable for very large projects.
- **Standardization**: It’s the same tool used by software engineers worldwide.
- **Positron**: Posit is even building a new IDE based on VS Code technology!
